<h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
<P>Although child abuse is a pervasive and complex problem with many causes, we should not take a defeatist
attitude toward its prevention. Despite the absence of strong evidence to guide our preventive efforts,
physicians can do many things to try to prevent abuse. At the very least, showing increased concern for the
parents or caregivers and increasing our attempts to enhance their skills as parents or caregivers may help
save our most vulnerable patients from the nightmare of abuse and neglect. In sum, rape and sexual abuse of
children in India is a large problem without an easy solution. Though the issue persists worldwide, India’s
culture which traditionally keeps women below men, makes talk of private matters such as such
unallowable, and a corrupt and weak legal system when it comes to rape makes the problems even larger.
However, the situation could be improved by appropriately educating children and adultson sexual abuse,
and educating police and strengthening laws. Further women’s empowerment may lead to healthy changes
as well.
